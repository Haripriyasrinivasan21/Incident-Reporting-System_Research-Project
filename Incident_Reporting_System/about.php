                <h3 class="card-title">Who We Are</h3>
                <p class="card-text">We are a team of innovators, researchers, and developers committed to advancing patient safety through smarter technology. Our Incident Reporting System is the result of in-depth analysis, hands-on development, and a shared mission to improve how clinical incidents are reported and addressed.
                    Driven by a belief that every report matters, we’ve built a solution that allows healthcare professionals to voice concerns anonymously, ensure accurate classification of incidents, and help foster positive, data-driven change within organisations.
                    Our approach blends modern software engineering with clinical insight—delivering a platform that’s intuitive, responsive, and designed to support fast reporting, clear communication, and continual learning in healthcare environments.
